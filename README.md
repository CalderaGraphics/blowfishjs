# blowfishjs

A javascript implementation of [Blowfish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29). A lot of credit goes to Alexandr Gorlov as this is essentially a fork of [agorlob/javascript-blowfish](https://github.com/agorlov/javascript-blowfish/).

## Motivation

It's actually hard to find a javascript blowfish implementation that:

- supports ECB
- supports arbitrary sized byte lengths
- has no dependencies
- supports AMD
- published on bower & npm
- is compatible with blowfish implentations in other languages
- is documented

This one isn't there yet either, but should be soon.
