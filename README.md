# blowfishjs

A javascript implementation of [Blowfish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29). A lot of credit goes to Alexandr Gorlov as this is essentially a fork of [agorlob/javascript-blowfish](https://github.com/agorlov/javascript-blowfish/).

## Motivation

It's actually hard to find a javascript blowfish implementation that:

- [x] supports ECB
- [x] supports arbitrary sized byte lengths
- [x] has no dependencies
- [x] supports AMD
- [x] published on bower & npm
- [ ] is compatible with blowfish implentations in other languages
- [ ] is documented

This one isn't there yet either, but should be soon.
